# Weather App

A simple and user-friendly weather application that allows users to check the current weather based on their location or search for any city's weather. The app provides the option to switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit), and stores the user's preference for future sessions.

## Features

- **Current Weather Information**: Get up-to-date weather information for your current location or any city you search for.
- **Temperature Units**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature display.
- **Persistent Settings**: The app remembers your preferred temperature unit across sessions (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple and intuitive interface for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The app is developed using Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development.
- **Retrofit + OkHttp**: Handles API requests efficiently, with OkHttp for network management and caching.
- **Gson**: Used as the JSON converter to parse weather data from the API.
- **BlurView**: Enhances the UI with smooth and aesthetically pleasing blur effects.
- **Glide**: Optimizes image loading and improves scrolling performance.
- **Android Jetpack Components**: Includes ViewModel, LiveData for efficient state management and data persistence.
## How to Use

### 1. Get Weather Information:
- Upon opening the app, it will show the current weather of your location (if location permission is granted).
- You can also search for any city by typing the city's name in the search bar.

### 2. Change Temperature Units:
- Use the toggle switch in the settings to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- The app will remember your selection and retain it even when you come back to the settings later.

### 3. Settings:
- In the settings screen, you can change the temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit). The switch will reflect your current preference.

## Code Structure
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for better maintainability and scalability.
